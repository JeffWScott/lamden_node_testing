Cilantro is a DPOS blockchain that focuses on performance, mass-adoption, and usability. This blockchain achieves 2,600 transactions per second per core. It is the first of its kind to accomplish scaling via eager execution and conflict resolution. The multiprocessing capabilities allow the network to scale linearly. Nodes that have 12 core CPUs will be able to process 2,600 x 12 = 31,200 transactions per second.

Cilantro also relies on Seneca, a Python smart contracting language. Seneca is designed to be simple to use and prototype solutions while remaining restrictive and covering security edge cases under the hood. It uses the same design principles as the Python Foundation to keep code clean and simple.

The singular goal of Cilantro is to be the most widely adopted blockchain for projects that require smart contracts, consensus, and decentralization.
